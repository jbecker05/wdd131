      <h1>Objection Playbook</h1>
      <p>
        This page gives you ready-to-use responses for the most common objections
        you’ll hear on the sales floor. Use these as a starting point, then tweak
        the wording so it still sounds like you.
      </p>

    <section class="playbook-intro">
      <h2>How to use this playbook</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Find the objection that matches what your customer says.</li>
        <li>Read the sample response out loud until it feels natural.</li>
        <li>Add your own examples, questions, or stories that fit your product.</li>
        <li>Practice the objection on the <a href="index.html#cards">flashcard trainer</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The goal isn’t to sound scripted. The goal is to be prepared so you can
        stay calm, confident, and helpful when a customer hesitates.

      <h2>Money & price objections</h2>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“I need to talk to my wife first.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Understand what matters to the other decision-maker and keep the momentum.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> Totally understand. A lot of my customers like to
          talk it over with their spouse first. 
          <br><br>
          So we make the most of your time here, what questions do you think
          your wife will ask? That way you can walk out with all the answers ready.
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“What matters most to her in a purchase like this?”</li>
          <li>“Is she more focused on price, protection, or convenience?”</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“It’s too expensive.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Reframe the price around value and long-term savings.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> I hear you. Nobody wants to overpay.
          If we look past the upfront price for a second, this actually
          <em>saves</em> you money if something goes wrong.
          <br><br>
          For example, if your screen cracked just once, the repair alone would
          cost more than this whole protection plan. Would it be helpful if I
          walked through a real-world scenario?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“What would be the most frustrating thing to pay for out of pocket?”</li>
          <li>“Have you ever had to pay for a repair like that before?”</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“Let me think about it.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Uncover the real concern behind the delay.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> For sure, it’s an important decision.
          When people tell me they want to think about it, it’s usually because
          they’re unsure about one or two things.
          <br><br>
          If you had to pick, what’s the biggest question still in your mind so
          I can clear that up before you go?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Is it more about the price, the coverage, or the timing?”</li>
          <li>“What would make this a ‘no-brainer’ for you?”</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="playbook-section">
      <h2>Trust & timing objections</h2>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“I don’t really need that.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Respect their point of view while educating them on risk.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> You might be right, and I never want to
          push anything you don’t need.
          <br><br>
          Most people who choose this didn’t think they’d need it either.
          They just wanted to be covered <em>if</em> something happened.
          Would it be okay if I showed you the top two things this protects you from?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“If something did happen, how big of a headache would that be?”</li>
          <li>“Would you rather pay a little now or risk paying a lot later?”</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“Can I come back later?”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Keep the door open and make it easy to commit now.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> You’re always welcome to come back.
          The only reason people usually handle it now is because they’re already
          here, and it saves them an extra trip.
          <br><br>
          If we could make this quick and simple, would there be any other reason
          not to get it taken care of today?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Is it more about time or budget right now?”</li>
          <li>“What would make it easier to move forward today?”</li>

      <h2>Customize these for your style</h2>
      <p>
        These scripts are meant to sound like a real conversation, not a robot.
        Once you find a few lines you like, rewrite them in your own words and
        practice them on the <a href="index.html#cards">flashcards</a> until they
        feel natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tip: Record yourself saying the script, then listen back. If it sounds
        awkward, tweak the wording until it matches how you really talk to customers.
