      <h2>Objection Playbook</h2>
      <p>
        This page gives you ready-to-use responses for the most common objections
        you’ll hear on the sales floor. Use these as a starting point, then tweak
        the wording so it still sounds like you.

    <section class="playbook-intro">
      <h2>How to use this playbook</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Find the objection that matches what your customer says.</li>
        <li>Read the sample response out loud until it feels natural.</li>
        <li>Add your own examples, questions, or stories that fit your product.</li>
        <li>Practice the objection on the <a href="index.html#cards">flashcard trainer</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The goal isn’t to sound scripted. The goal is to be prepared so you can
        stay calm, confident, and helpful when a customer hesitates.

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“I need to talk to my wife first.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Understand what matters to the other decision-maker and keep the momentum.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> Totally understand. A lot of my customers like to
          talk it over with their spouse first. 
          <br><br>
          So we make the most of your time here, what questions do you think
          your wife will ask? That way you can walk out with all the answers ready.
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“What matters most to her in a purchase like this?”</li>
          <li>“Is she more focused on price, protection, or convenience?”</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="playbook-card">
        <h3>“It’s too expensive.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Reframe the price around value and long-term savings.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> I hear you. Nobody wants to overpay.
          If we look past the upfront price for a second, this actually
          <em>saves</em> you money if something goes wrong.
          <br><br>
          For example, if your screen cracked just once, the repair alone would
          cost more than this whole protection plan. Would it be helpful if I
          walked through a real-world scenario?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“What would be the most frustrating thing to pay for out of pocket?”</li>
          <li>“Have you ever had to pay for a repair like that before?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>“Let me think about it.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Uncover the real concern behind the delay.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> For sure, it’s an important decision.
          When people tell me they want to think about it, it’s usually because
          they’re unsure about one or two things.
          <br><br>
          If you had to pick, what’s the biggest question still in your mind so
          I can clear that up before you go?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Is it more about the price, the coverage, or the timing?”</li>
          <li>“What would make this a ‘no-brainer’ for you?”</li>

        <h3>“I can probably find it cheaper online.”</h3>
        <p class="label">Goal:</p>
        <p>Respect their desire to save money while highlighting the value of in-person service.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> You might be able to, and I always respect people who want to save money.
          The main difference here is that you’re getting it set up correctly today with someone you can
          come back to if there’s an issue.
          <br><br>
          If the price were close and the service was better here, would it still make sense to go online?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“How important is it to have someone local you can come back to?”</li>
          <li>“If the total cost ends up about the same, which feels like the better experience for you?”</li>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> You might be right, and I never want to
          push anything you don’t need.
          <br><br>
          Most people who choose this didn’t think they’d need it either.
          They just wanted to be covered <em>if</em> something happened.
          Would it be okay if I showed you the top two things this protects you from?
        </p>

        <p class="label">Follow-up questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“If something did happen, how big of a headache would that be?”</li>
          <li>“Would you rather pay a little now or risk paying a lot later?”</li>

        <p>Keep the door open and make it easy to commit now.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> You’re always welcome to come back.
          The only reason people usually handle it now is because they’re already
          here, and it saves them an extra trip.
          <br><br>
          If we could make this quick and simple, would there be any other reason
          not to get it taken care of today?

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> I get that. Nobody wants to feel rushed.
          My goal isn’t to pressure you, it’s to make sure you’ve got all the info so whatever
          decision you make feels solid.
          <br><br>
          What would you need to know right now to feel comfortable either saying yes or no today?

        <p>Gently bring the decision back to the present while still offering information.</p>

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> I can definitely give you info to take with you.
          The tricky part is most people don’t come back, even when they mean to, and then if
          something happens they wish they’d just handled it while they were here.
          <br><br>
          If we walked through the key points together now and answered your questions, would that
          help you decide today instead of pushing it off?

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> That’s awesome, and it already puts you ahead of most people.
          The plan isn’t really for what you expect to happen—it’s for the one time something random
          happens, like a drop in the parking lot or a kid grabbing it.
          <br><br>
          If that worst-case scenario did happen once in the next couple of years, would you rather pay
          out of pocket or have it covered?

        <p class="label">Sample response:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> Totally fair. A lot of people who get this have never needed it before either—
          they just like knowing that if this is the one time they do, they’re covered.
          <br><br>
          If this turns out to be the one device that does have an issue, would you want that backup in place

        These scripts are meant to sound like a real conversation, not a robot.
        Once you find a few lines you like, rewrite them in your own words and
        practice them on the <a href="index.html#cards">flashcards</a> until they
        feel natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tip: Record yourself saying the script, then listen back. If it sounds
        awkward, tweak the wording until it matches how you really talk to customers.
