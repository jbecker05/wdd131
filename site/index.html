          Practice real-world objections like “I have to talk to my wife” or
          “It’s too expensive” using interactive flashcards. The more you
          practice, the smoother your conversations will feel.

      <h2>How this site helps you sell more</h2>
      <p>
        Sales conversations can feel awkward when a customer throws out an
        objection you’re not ready for. This site gives you a low-pressure way to
        practice so you’re not guessing in front of a real customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll work through common objections, see proven responses, and customize
        them to match your style. Use the cards during your downtime at work or at
        home to keep your skills sharp.

        <li>Read longer scripts and talk tracks in the playbook</li>
